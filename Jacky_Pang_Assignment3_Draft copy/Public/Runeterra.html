                What is Legends of Runeterra
              </h3>
              <div class="left">
              <P>
                League of Legends has been around for more than 10 years now and, with Legends of Runeterra, Riot Games is hoping to capitalise on that heritage to propel its world and characters into a whole new genre: digital collectible card games (CCGs). The result is stylish, exciting, cleverly designed, and full of nods to League of Legends Fans.

                Importantly, while Legends of Runeterra is firmly rooted in an established world, it in no way excludes newcomers who may be picking it up because of its genre instead of its MOBA pedigree. It's very much like Blizzard's Hearthstone in that way; I personally came to Hearthstone without any real knowledge of Warcraft, and six years later I'm still playing. Legends of Runeterra is no doubt hoping to also bottle that lightning.
              </P>
              <p>
                
                That said, when Hearthstone burst onto the scene, it upended the gameplay of other collectible card games like Magic: The Gathering by being more straightforward and thus more accessible. Legends of Runeterra, on the other hand, sits somewhere in the middle, with some mechanics that streamline gameplay and others that ambitiously add layers of depth and complexity other games haven't attempted.

                The overall goal of a match, however, is much the same; each player brings a deck of 40 pre-selected cards and faces off against an opponent, to the death. Initiative is passed back and forth, allowing each person to play units to the board, cast spells, and choose how to attack or defend. The match is won or lost when one combatant reduces the health of their opponent's Nexus from 20 down to zero.
